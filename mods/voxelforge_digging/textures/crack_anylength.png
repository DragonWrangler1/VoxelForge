# This is a placeholder for the crack texture
# In a real implementation, this would be a PNG file with 5 vertical frames
# showing progressive cracking stages from 0 (no cracks) to 4 (almost broken)
# 
# The texture should be 16x80 pixels (16x16 per frame, 5 frames vertically)
# Frame 0: No cracks (transparent or very light lines)
# Frame 1: Small cracks
# Frame 2: Medium cracks  
# Frame 3: Large cracks
# Frame 4: Very large cracks, almost broken
#
# For now, this file serves as a placeholder to prevent texture loading errors
